# Research Data Management (RDM)

## Overview 

This RDM workshop is designed to give a generic overview of RDM principles and practices. In most research fields there are field specific and community driven standards and practices, especially for file organization and metadata. This workshop does not address this field specific standards as it was designed for a broad audience from different research areas. 

## Topics ðŸ’¡

Under the following sections you'll find the `objectives` for each of the topics we'll discuss during this workshop and further `materials/readings`.
