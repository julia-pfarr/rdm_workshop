# Contributing to RDM Workshop

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:
- Star the project
- Tweet about it
- Refer this project in your project's readme
- Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked through pull requests.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to the RDM workshop. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
